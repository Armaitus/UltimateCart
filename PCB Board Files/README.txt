Eagle files for the PCB.

v2 removes an un-needed pull-up resistor on the SD card CS line.
It also includes fixes to the paste layer so you can order a stencil from the board file.
Finally, it adds a funky logo to the top of the board to match the label.

v3 adds a 47k pull-up resistor (marked R11) to SD card as discussed in the erratum on the main page. R11 is on the SD card side of the board, near the SD card slot itself.
