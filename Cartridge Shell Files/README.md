STL files for 3d printing a shell for the Ultimate Cart.

Notes

The overall shape and dimensions were matched to an XL-era Atari Cartridge.

I sliced with Cura and printed on a Wanhao Duplicator i3 v2.1

Front and back are optimised for printing with a 0.3mm layer height.
The front requires support (i.e. scaffolding) under the reccess for the logo insert.

The logo was designed for a 0.2mm layer height, with a filament change after the third layer.

The OpenSCAD source files are supplied, should you want to tweak the design. Its probably not a good example of how to use OpenSCAD - this was my first attempt to use the software.

Requires 2 x M3 14mm screw (or slightly longer)
